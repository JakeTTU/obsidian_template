# What is DataView: 
DataView is an Obsidian plugin that enables you to create dynamic tables, lists, and queries within your notes by leveraging the metadata stored in your notes. With DataView, you can extract, filter, and display information from your notes in a structured and customizable format.

# Key Features:
Here are some key features of the DataView plugin:

1. **Custom Queries:** DataView allows you to write custom queries in your notes using a special syntax. These queries can extract specific information from your notes, such as tags, dates, or custom attributes.
    
2. **Dynamic Tables:** You can create dynamic tables within your notes that automatically update based on the results of your queries. This is particularly useful for creating tables that summarize information from multiple notes.
    
3. **Filtering:** DataView supports filtering, which means you can display only the information that meets certain criteria. For example, you can create a table that shows all notes tagged with "project" and due within the next week.
    
4. **Custom Attributes:** You can define custom attributes for your notes, allowing you to attach additional metadata to them. DataView lets you query and display this metadata in your notes.
