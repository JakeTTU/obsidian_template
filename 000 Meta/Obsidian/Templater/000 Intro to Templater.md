# What is Templater: 
Templater is a plugin for Obsidian that streamlines the process of creating new notes by using templates. It enables you to define custom templates with placeholders for various types of content, such as text, dates, or even code snippets. When you create a new note based on a template, Templater automatically fills in the placeholders with the content you specify, saving you time and ensuring consistency in your notes.
